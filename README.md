Aerospike Nim Client

very very very wip, bc only "backend" is in development, "frontend" is not started yet

### how to make it work ??
you need to install C client shared library

on linux:
* clone [c client repo](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-c)
* build with `make [specify eventlib if you need]`
* run install script `make install` with sudo privileges
